==================================
mqtt-codec Package Documentation
==================================

The `mqtt-codec` package is an MQTT packet parser.  The library is
feature complete but test coverage and testing is not yet complete; the
library is therefore not yet worthy of a 1.0 version (2018-09-30).


Installation
=============

The mqtt-codec package is distributed through
`pypi.org <https://pypi.org>`_ and can be installed with the standard
Python package manager `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install mqtt-codec

If you do not have pip then the package can be downloaded from
`mqtt-codec <https://pypi.org/project/mqtt-codec>`_ and installed with
the standard `setup.py` method:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py install
